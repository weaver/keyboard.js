# Keyboard.js #

This module provides friendly, cross-browser support for handling
keyboard events. Declare a virtual keyboard, bind it to an element,
and define keys some keys.

    Keyboard()
      .bind(document)
      .define({
        'Control+Alt+$': function(ev) {
          alert('Got Control+Alt+$');
        }
      });

Utilities for parsing and formatting friendly names are also
exported. This makes it easy to add configurable keyboard shortcuts to
your application.

## Installation ##

Grab a copy of `lib/keyboard.js` and add it to your project.
Keyboard.js is designed for use with an asynchronous CommonJS module
system like [Require.js][1]:

    define(['lib/keyboard'], function(Kb) {
      Kb.Keyboard()
        // methods here ...
    });

If you're not using a module system, uncomment the indicated line at
the top of the file to define `window.Kb`:

    Kb.Keyboard()
      // methods here...

## Compatibility ##

Keyboard.js has been tested in these browsers. If you find a bug,
please report it in the issue tracker.

## Key Names ##

Key handlers are defined using friendly names. Primary keys and
modifier keys are separated by `+`. Supported modifier keys are:
`Alt`, `Control`, and `Shift`.

Primary keys are named as they appear on the keyboard with the
exception of special keys and `+`, which is called `Plus`.

Special key names are listed in the [DOM 3 Events][2]
specification. Currently supported are:

    Backspace
    Tab
    Enter (or Return)
    Shift
    Control
    Alt
    CapsLock
    Esc
    Spacebar
    PageUp
    PageDown
    End
    Home
    Left
    Up
    Right
    Down
    Del

## API ##

These public methods are available:

**Keyboard([keys])**

Create a new keyboard instance.

**.bind(el)**
**.bind(type, el)**

Listen for keystrokes on an element. If `type` is not given, handle
`keyup` events. The keyboard works best with `keydown` or `keyup`;
support for `keypress` is untested and may behave strangely.

**.define(object)**
**.define(name, callback)**

Add new key handlers. If `object` is given, expect that it's a mapping
of `(name, callback)` items.

**key(event)**

Convert a DOM event to a `Key` object.

**title(name)**

A shortcut for `format(parse(name))`.

**parse(name)**

Parse a friendly name into a `Key` object.

**format(key)**

Convert a `Key` object to a friendly name.
